Guide for Intern Students: Investigating Language Models 📚🔍

Objective: Study and analyze the properties and capabilities of language models using their tokens and sentences involving them. This will allow for a better understanding of how models process information and generate responses. 🎯

Introduction to language models 🧠
a. Basics of language models (GPT, BERT, and others) 📖
b. How transformers and attention mechanisms work ⚙️
c. Token dictionary and their use in models 🔤

Preparation for research 📝
a. Choosing a language model for investigation (e.g., mGPT) 🔍
b. Gaining access to the model and its weights 📥
c. Familiarization with information extraction techniques from models (kMeans, ANN, NGT, etc.) 🛠️

Token investigation 🔎
a. Studying tokens closest to the centroid 📍
b. Determining the token's language and meaning 🌐
c. Analyzing the context of the token's usage in the model 📚
d. Identifying possible relationships between tokens and their meanings 🧩
e. Determining if the model has knowledge about this token 🧐

Text generation experiments 📄
a. Querying the model using tokens ❓
b. Evaluating the quality of the model's responses ✅
c. Checking for biases or errors in responses ⚠️
d. Attempting to prompt the model to generate text with specific keywords 🎯

Results analysis 📊
a. Systematizing the collected data 📈
b. Identifying general patterns and trends 🔍
c. Detecting potential issues and limitations of language models ❗
d. Forming conclusions and recommendations for further research or model usage 💡

Report preparation 📑
a. Presenting research results in the form of text or a presentation 📄
b. Discussing results with supervisor 👥
